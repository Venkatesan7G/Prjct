Attendance System Based Machine Learning (Face Recognition And Mask Detection)

Intially run encode_face.py with datasets added in a dataset folder,this provides a pickel file for detection
Then run Pi_face_recognition , it recognises faces and the out put can be seen in "http://www.iotclouddata.com/20log/337/iot20.php"

Try to run in Pi3 as its optimized better for this code.
